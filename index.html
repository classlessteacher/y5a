<p> This is a image of the new cutlury for the elderly. This idea is based of my 
  Friend Sebastian's grandma has a disorder which makes it hard for her to hold things
  And this is why we have wrapped this materialaround it. </p>

<ul>
  <li> This product is washable</li>
  <li> It is made out of high quality material called polar</li>
  <li> This product is $ 3.00</li>
  <li> It fits on any material</li>
</ul>

<p> This is a very useful product hope you like it
This product will help you if you cant hold untensils well so if you cant buy on of are tools.</p>

                                                                                                                       </body>
